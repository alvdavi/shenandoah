 * A {@code PauseDetails} object represents a pause event impacting

 * specific to the implementation of the Java virtual machine, and
 * unique across all pause reasons.
 * <p>
 * {@code PauseDetails} also has additional, optional, details of the time
 * required for individual steps executed during the pause. The times for
 * the individual steps make it easy to identify potential areas for
 * reducing the total pause duration. Generally, the sum of the
 * additional detailed timing information's times should add up to the
 * total pause duration.
